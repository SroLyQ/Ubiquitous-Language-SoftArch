| Base Rate         | This is the minimum rate at which a bank can lend to its customers. It cannot lend below the base rate. All interest rates determined for various loans will use the base rate as the benchmark.                                                                                                                                               |
| Cashback          | Cashback is an offer provided primarily by credit card companies where they offer some amount of money back to the cardholder that he/she has spent on the card.
